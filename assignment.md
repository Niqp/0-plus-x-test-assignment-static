# 0+X Frontend Test Assignment

In this assignment, your task will take 3 parts:

- Fix a bug in the code;
- Add a new feature to the existing code;
- Conduct a code review to outline all the problems with the code.

## Bug Fix

This project is a React app. It shows a gallery of sorted otter images and a featured image below the gallry ^\_^

The current code has a bug. Sometimes the image in the featured block is rendered incorrectly: the image isn't related to the description of the block.

Your task is to find the reason for this inconsistency and fix it.

## New Feature

After you've fixed the bug, your task is to implement a new feature for the app.

Right now the images are sorted by the `cuteness` property and only in the ascending order. You will need to implement a toggler for sorting by different properties and different sorting orders (ascending or descending).

You're going to have to add a new control in the UI and program its functionality for changing the image sorting.

## Code Review

The existing code isn't flawless. We'd like you to conduct a code review, find problems with the code, and give the feedback.
